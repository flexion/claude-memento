# Session Workflow

## Overview

Sessions are the long-term memory system for Claude projects. They persist work context across conversation resets, branch switches, and team handoffs.

**Core Concept**: 1 Session = 1 Issue = 1 Branch = 1 Branch Metadata File

## The Problem Sessions Solve

**Without sessions:**
- Context lost when conversation reset
- Can't remember what was tried or decided
- No handoff mechanism for teammates
- Work scattered across conversations

**With sessions:**
- Persistent memory across conversations
- Decisions and learnings documented
- Teammates can read session and continue work
- Work traceable to issues/PRs

## Session Files

**Location**: `.claude/sessions/`

**Naming**:
- Feature/Fix with issue: `<IssueNumber>-<desc>.md` (e.g., `123-add-authentication.md`)
- Chore: `chore-<desc>.md` (e.g., `chore-update-deps.md`)

**Content Structure**:
- Details (issue, branch, type, created, status)
- Objective/Goal
- Session Log (timestamped entries)
- Key Decisions (with rationale)
- Learnings
- Files Changed
- Next Steps

## Branch Metadata Files

**Location**: `.claude/branches/`

**Naming**: Branch name with `/` → `-`
- `issue/feature-123/add-auth` → `issue-feature-123-add-auth`
- `chore/update-deps` → `chore-update-deps`

**Content** (compact, ~10 lines):
```
# Branch Metadata
branch: issue/feature-123/add-authentication
session: 123-add-authentication.md
type: feature
status: in-progress
created: 2024-01-15
last-updated: 2024-01-17
description: add-authentication
parent: main
issue: 123

## Current Work
Implementing JWT authentication system

## Next Steps
Create PR for authentication implementation
```

## Tools

### get-session.js

**Purpose**: Determine current session from branch

**Usage**:
```bash
node .claude/tools/get-session.js
# Output:
# Branch: issue/feature-123/add-authentication
# Session: /path/to/.claude/sessions/123-add-authentication.md
# Status: in-progress
# Type: feature
# Issue: #123

# JSON output:
node .claude/tools/get-session.js --json

# Just the path:
node .claude/tools/get-session.js --path

# Session content:
node .claude/tools/get-session.js --content
```

### create-session.js

**Purpose**: Create branch metadata and session file

**Usage**:
```bash
# After creating branch
git checkout -b issue/feature-123/add-authentication
node .claude/tools/create-session.js

# Creates:
# - .claude/branches/issue-feature-123-add-authentication
# - .claude/sessions/123-add-authentication.md

# Force overwrite existing:
node .claude/tools/create-session.js --force
```

### Updating Sessions

Session updates are **collaborative** between Claude and the user:
- Claude edits the session file directly using the Edit tool
- User reviews changes in git diff or IDE
- Both can add log entries, decisions, learnings

This keeps session maintenance flexible and conversational rather than forcing a rigid CLI interface.

## Workflow

### Starting New Work

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b issue/feature-123/add-authentication

# Create metadata and session
node .claude/tools/create-session.js

# Start working - session file auto-created with template
```

### During Work

**Update session after**:
- Beginning work (document approach)
- After milestone (what completed, decisions made)
- Before pausing (capture current state)
- When blocked (document blocker)
- Before commit (document changes)

Claude edits the session file directly. User can ask "update session" or Claude can proactively suggest updates at natural checkpoints.

### Resuming Work

**User asks**: "What's next?"

**Claude must**:
1. Run `node .claude/tools/get-session.js` (get branch and session)
2. Read the session file (find "Next Steps" section)

**NEVER guess** current branch - always check.

### Completing Work

```bash
# Update session status to complete (Claude edits directly)
# Then commit session + code together (atomic)
git add .claude/sessions/123-add-authentication.md src/
git commit -m "#123 - add authentication system"

# Create PR
gh pr create --base main --fill
```

## Key Patterns

### Session as Memory

When conversation resets or context window fills:
1. Start new conversation
2. Run `get-session.js`
3. Read session file
4. Full context restored

### Branch-Session Coupling

```
Branch switch → Session switch (automatic)
```

Metadata file maps branch to session, enabling automatic context loading.

### Atomic Commits

```bash
# Session update + code changes = single commit
git add .claude/sessions/123-add-auth.md src/
git commit -m "..."
```

Session is versioned WITH the code it describes.

### Handoffs

```
Teammate: git checkout issue/feature-123/add-auth
→ Run get-session.js
→ Read session file
→ Full context of what was done, why, what's next
```

## Best Practices

### Update Frequently
Don't wait until commit - update throughout work.

### Document Decisions
WHY you chose an approach, not just WHAT you implemented.

### Capture Learnings
What did you learn? What surprised you? What would you do differently?

### Keep It Real
Session is truth - don't embellish or hide failures.

### Commit Together
Session + code = atomic commit. They version together.

## Branch Naming Patterns

The tools support multiple platforms:

| Platform | Pattern | Session File |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| GitHub | `issue/feature-N/desc` | `N-desc.md` |
| Jira | `feature/PROJ-123/desc` | `PROJ-123-desc.md` |
| Azure DevOps | `feature/456/desc` | `456-desc.md` |
| No issue | `chore/desc` | `chore-desc.md` |
