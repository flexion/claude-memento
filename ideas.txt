"Remember Sammy Jankis."

  Like Leonard in Memento, Claude can't form long-term memories. claude-memento gives Claude its tattoos—session 
  files that persist decisions, progress, and context across conversation resets. 

In Christopher Nolan's Memento (2000), Leonard Shelby suffers from anterograde amnesia—he can't form new 
  memories. Every few minutes, his slate wipes clean. To function, he tattoos critical facts on his body and leaves
   himself Polaroids and notes. Each morning he wakes up, pieces together his own breadcrumbs, and continues his 
  mission.

Claude has the same problem. Context window fills up, conversation resets, and everything learned—decisions made,
   approaches tried, dead ends discovered—vanishes. claude-memento is Leonard's system for Claude: persistent 
  session files that survive the reset, letting Claude wake up, read its own notes, and pick up exactly where it 
  left off.

  - Intended to work in concert with source control
    - this branch has this session file
    - all the decisions, todos, and context to work on this feature/chore are easily referenciable by this branch
  - Persists important todos, decisions across claude sessions by persisting them in a file
  - 1 Session = 1 Issue = 1 Branch - enforces clean mapping between work units
  - Branch metadata files - compact lookup to find session from current branch
  - Session templates - standardized structure for feature vs chore sessions
  - Automatic context restoration - "What's next?" triggers branch → session → next steps lookup
  - Session log - chronological record of what was done, when, and why
  - Key decisions documentation - captures WHY, not just WHAT (architectural rationale)
  - Learnings capture - what surprised you, what would you do differently
  - Files changed tracking - inventory of modified files for handoff
  - Atomic commits - session file versions WITH the code it describes
  - Team handoffs - teammate checks out branch, reads session, has full context
  - Survives conversation resets - context window fills up, start new chat, read session, continue
  - Survives context compaction - when Claude summarizes, session file has the real details
  - Progress checkpointing - update throughout work, not just at the end
  - Blockers documentation - capture what's blocking and why before stepping away
